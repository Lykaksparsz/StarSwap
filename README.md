* Load and unload installed mods. (Currently Steam Workshop only.)
* Monitor the Steam Workshop for mod updates, and apply them.
* Ask if you would like to backup your mods/saves, without being intrusive.
* Backup mods and saves on demand.
* Uninstall itself!
 
## Requirements

StarSwap requires:
* A Windows PC that is Windows Vista or higher. (Sorry Windows XP users!)
