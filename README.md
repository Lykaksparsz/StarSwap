# **StarSwap** ~ Version 1.0.0

StarSwap is a batch program to swap and backup Vanilla/Modded Starbound configurations. (Steam only!)

## Features

StarSwap can:
* Swap between a Vanilla/Modded Starbound save.
* Load and unload installed mods. (Currently Steam Workshop only.)
* Monitor the Steam Workshop for mod updates, and apply them.
* Ask if you would like to backup your mods/saves, without being intrusive.
* Backup mods and saves on demand.
 
## Requirements

StarSwap requires:
* A Windows PC that is Windows Vista or higher. (Sorry Windows XP users!)
* A Steam based installation of Starbound, with mods installed through Steam Workshop only.

**Do not use this tool if you have both Steam Workshop mods and directly downloaded mods.**

* Access to "robocopy", which has been included with Windows since Windows Vista.
* Administrator permissions, to make changes to Starbound's storage.

## Usage
